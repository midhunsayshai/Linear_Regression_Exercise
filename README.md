**Canada Per Capita Income Prediction (2020)**
This project focuses on predicting Canada’s Per Capita Income for the year 2020 using historical economic data and a simple machine learning model.
The objective is to understand the trend in income growth and apply predictive analytics techniques to estimate future income values.

**Objective**
The main goal of this project is to:
Analyze historical data on Canada’s per capita income.
Identify the trend and relationship between income values over time.
Build a Linear Regression predictive machine learning model.
Predict Canada’s Per Capita Income for the year 2020 using the trained model.

**Tools Used**
Libraries used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn
Model: Linear Regression
Visualization:	Matplotlib / Seaborn

**Dataset**
The dataset contains historical records of Canada’s per capita income from previous years.
Key features include: Year, Per Capita Income, The dataset is simple and ideal for demonstrating regression modeling concepts.

**Machine Learning Approach**
Load and Explore the Dataset
Visualize Trends Using Line & Scatter Plots
Prepare Data for Modeling
Train a Linear Regression Model
Evaluate the Model Performance
Predict the Per Capita Income for 2020

**Results**
The model learns the trend present in the historical dataset and predicts the estimated per capita income for 2020.

Predicted Value (approximate): 41288.6940

**Key Learning Outcomes**
